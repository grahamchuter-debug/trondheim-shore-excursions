      "The Molde to Bud Scenic Drive and Atlantic Ocean Road tour is the headline choice when you have four or more hours in port. For shorter calls, the City of Roses and Mount Varden Viewpoint tour fits comfortably within return-to-ship timings.",

    question: "How do I choose between Molde shore excursions?",
    answer:
      "Match the tour to your hours ashore: Mount Varden suits under-four-hour calls; Atlantic Ocean Road and fishing village tours suit 4–6 hours; private coastal drives suit 6–8 hours and longer. Use the Cruise Smart Planner on the homepage to compare options.",

    question: "Do Molde excursions depart near the cruise port?",

            Each tour below is designed for cruise passengers calling at Molde.
            Atlantic Ocean Road drives need the longest port window; Mount
            Varden and harbour walks fit shorter schedules. Private tours suit
            families wanting flexible coastal pacing.
