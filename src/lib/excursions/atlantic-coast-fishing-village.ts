  description: [
    "The Atlantic Coast and Fishing Village Experience emphasises culture and coastline rather than rushing between checkpoints. From Molde you follow the shore toward communities where fishing shaped daily life — wooden quays, small churches, and harbours that still feel connected to the North Atlantic.",
    "Bud and neighbouring villages provide the human story behind the scenery: how cod and herring economies built these settlements, how storms and wars touched the coast, and why photography enthusiasts return for moody skies and weather-beaten facades.",
    "Ocean road sections add iconic bridge views when the itinerary includes Atlanterhavsveien segments — the same dramatic curves that define Molde-region marketing, framed here with more time for village walks and history than a pure scenic dash.",
    "This tour sits between the headline Atlantic Ocean Road drive and the short City of Roses outing — a strong match for four-to-six-hour port calls in our Cruise Smart Planner when you want coastal character without booking a private vehicle.",

    {
      question: "How is this different from the headline Atlantic Ocean Road tour?",
      answer:
        "Both visit coastal highlights, but the fishing village experience spends more time on community heritage, harbour walks, and photography rather than maximising bridge viewpoints alone.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does this tour always include the Atlantic Ocean Road bridges?",
      answer:
        "Most itineraries include ocean road scenery; confirm bridge stops on your operator voucher as routes can vary by season and traffic.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this tour suitable for photographers?",
      answer:
        "Yes — fishing villages, rugged coastlines, and open-ocean outlooks are core themes with built-in photo stops.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I book this on a short port call?",
      answer:
        "It needs at least four hours ashore. Under four hours, choose the City of Roses and Mount Varden tour or a harbour walk.",
