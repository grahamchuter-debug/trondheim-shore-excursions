  description: [
    "The Baneheia and Ravnedalen Nature Trek is Kristiansand's answer to guests who want green space and fresh air rather than harbour-only touring. Baneheia rises above the city centre with a network of forest trails, granite outcrops, and viewpoints that look out over the Skagerrak coast and inland woodland.",
    "Ravnedalen valley park adds a softer landscape of tree-lined paths, small lakes, and sheltered glades that feel worlds away from the cruise pier yet sit minutes from town. Your guide sets a steady pace suited to moderate fitness, with rest stops at viewpoints where southern Norway's mix of coastal light and forest shade creates memorable photography.",
    "This tour suits guests who enjoy walking holidays and want something distinctly different from Norway's fjord ports. The activity level is moderate: expect uneven paths, some inclines, and around four to five hours including transfers and trail time.",
    "Because trail touring needs a meaningful port window, this excursion fits four-to-six-hour calls and longer. It is the anchor active recommendation in our Cruise Smart Planner for guests with enough hours ashore.",
