    "The Family and Beach Day tour recognises that not every Kristiansand port call needs a museum marathon. For families with children, Bystranda city beach delivers the rare combination of a Blue Flag sandy shore right in the city centre, shallow water, and promenade facilities that make a beach day practical on a cruise schedule.",
    "The Aquarama area adjacent to Bystranda adds indoor swimming and leisure options when weather turns, giving families a backup plan without leaving the harbour district. The waterfront promenade connects beach time to gentle sightseeing: fortress views, marina boats, and ice cream stops that keep children engaged.",
    "Your guide paces the day around family needs: bathroom breaks, snack stops, and realistic walking distances. Optional time at Fiskebrygga introduces children to the fish market atmosphere without the pressure of a full cultural tour.",
    "This excursion suits three-to-four-hour port calls and longer. It is the default family recommendation in our Cruise Smart Planner and pairs well with independent playground time if your ship stays six hours or more.",

    {
      question: "Can we combine the beach day with other tours?",

        "On six-hour or longer port calls, some families do a morning highlights tour and afternoon beach time. Use the Cruise Smart Planner to check your margin.",

    {
      question: "Is this tour available outside summer?",
      answer:
        "The tour operates in the cruise season, but beach time is most rewarding May through August. Shoulder-season sailings focus more on promenade walks and town time.",
