    "The Harbour, Fortress and Fish Market Walk concentrates Kristiansand's most searched waterfront sights into one efficient shore excursion. This is the tour for cruise passengers asking whether they can see the fish market and fortress on a very short port call. The answer is yes, and this walk shows you how.",
    "Fiskebrygga anchors the route with its canal-side fish market, seafood stalls, and waterfront restaurants that capture southern Norway's coastal dining culture. The atmosphere shifts from working harbour to leisure promenade as you approach Christiansholm Fortress, the well-preserved circular fort that has guarded Kristiansand's eastern entrance since 1672.",
    "The marina and guest harbour sections deliver classic Skagerrak scenery: masts, granite shoreline, and views toward Odderøya peninsula. Local food stops are optional but recommended when time allows, fresh shellfish and market snacks give a taste of Agder's maritime cuisine.",
    "At under two and a half hours, this is the most compact featured tour on the site. It pairs naturally with independent time in the Kvadraturen if your ship stays slightly longer than expected.",

      question: "Can I see the fish market and fortress on a short Kristiansand port call?",

      question: "How is this different from the Walking Exploration tour?",

      question: "Is the fish market open when cruise ships visit?",
      answer:
        "Fiskebrygga operates year-round with peak activity in summer. Market stalls and restaurants are typically open during standard cruise port hours.",

    {
      question: "Can I buy seafood to take back to the ship?",
      answer:
        "Check your cruise line's policy on bringing food aboard. Many guests enjoy seafood at Fiskebrygga restaurants rather than taking items back to the ship.",
