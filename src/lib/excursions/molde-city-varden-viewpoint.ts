    "When your ship grants limited hours in port, the City of Roses and Mount Varden tour delivers Molde's essentials without the long drive to the Atlantic Ocean Road. Your guide introduces the harbour — where cruise ships meet local ferries and coastal life — then the town centre known for roses, parks, and relaxed Nordic urban charm.",
    "Mount Varden rises behind Molde with a cable car or walking path to a viewpoint that looks across the town, Moldefjord, and on clear days the jagged Romsdal Alps — one of the great panoramas on the Norwegian cruise circuit. Commentary explains why Molde brands itself the City of Roses and how the Romsdal landscape shapes local identity.",

    "Our Cruise Smart Planner flags this tour for under-four-hour and tight four-hour port calls — the practical choice when Atlantic Ocean Road touring would cut too close to your gangway deadline.",
